This project is a website for a dental clinic named "WJ Smile Clinic". The website provides information about the clinic's services, team members, and contact details. It features a responsive design implemented using Bootstrap, ensuring that the website adapts well to various screen sizes and devices.

Special Instructions:

To view the webpage, you can simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Make sure to have an active internet connection if any external resources (such as Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files) are not downloaded locally.

If you want to test the responsiveness of the webpage, you can resize the browser window or open the webpage on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to see how it adjusts to different screen sizes.

Ensure that you have a compatible browser installed, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge, for the best viewing experience.
